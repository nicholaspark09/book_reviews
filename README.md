|----------|---------|-------------|
| [Book Reflection](templates/book-reflection-template.md) | Quick capture of key ideas and personal takeaways | For every book |
| [Detailed Summary](templates/book-summary-template.md) | Comprehensive outline of the book's content | For complex or significant books |

### Using Templates

To create a new book review:

1. Choose the appropriate template
2. Copy the template content
3. Create a new file in the correct category folder
4. Fill in the template sections
5. Add the book to relevant lists (recently read, recommendations, etc.)

Example file naming: `reviews/non-fiction/psychology/thinking-fast-and-slow.md`
