## Templates

To maintain consistency across reviews, I use the following templates:

| Template | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| [Book Reflection](templates/book-reflection-template.md) | Quick capture of key ideas and personal takeaways | For every book |
| [Detailed Summary](templates/book-summary-template.md) | Comprehensive outline of the book's content | For complex or significant books |
| [Formal Review](templates/book-review-template.md) | Evaluative critique with rating and recommendation | For sharing with others |
| [Connection Map](templates/connection-map-template.md) | Mapping relationships between multiple books | After reading related books |

### Using Templates

To create a new book review:

1. Choose the appropriate template
2. Copy the template content
3. Create a new file in the correct category folder
4. Fill in the template sections
5. Add the book to relevant lists (recently read, recommendations, etc.)

Example file naming: `reviews/non-fiction/psychology/thinking-fast-and-slow.md`
