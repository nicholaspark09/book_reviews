## Context
*James Darnell is a scientist who made significant contributions to RNA processing. In this book, he discusses the history of RNA research and the complexity of how RNA is processed and is eventually converted or not into proteins..*

## Central Thesis
*James Darnell reveals the importance of RNA to life and its essential functions in life. He delineates its importance by also showing how RNA was proved to be so essential by various scientists and groundbreaking experiments over time. Darnell argues that RNA, not proteins, serves as life's most indispensable molecule challenging the traditional protein-centric view of cellular function. RNA's roles in catalysis, regulation, and information transfer make it fundamental to life and its processes as demonstrated by experiments throughout the 20th century.*

## Key Frameworks and Models
*List and briefly explain the most important frameworks introduced*

1. **RNA is Crucial to the Central Dogma**: 
   - Core concept: DNA->RNA->Proteins. RNA is the piece that connects the genetic code to the making, or not making, proteins. 
   - Application: RNA polymerase binds to promoter sequences on DNA, proteins bind to an operator sequence, and then RNA polymerase starts to transcribe the pre-mRNA of the structural genes that encode for proteins. The operon itself contains the promoter, operator (in prokaryotes), and structural genes. The mRNA itself is then transcribed into proteins via the Ribosome and the tRNA that matches the three letter sequences with their corresponding proteins. 

2. **Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Differ Significantly in RNA Processing**: 
   - Core concept: mRNA transcripts are often immediately functional in prokaryotes. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, undergo specific and complex splicing after pre-mRNA is transcribed.
   - Application: Often it appears to be much simpler to observe the process in prokaryotes because they don't undergo splicing of rna; the functional mRNA can be directly used after its RNA Polymerase has transcribe the mRNA. In Eukaryotes, pre-mRNA is spliced by a Spliceosome, which itself is composed of snRNA and proteins, so that introns are removed and exons are joined together. There is a modified guanine nucleotide added to the 5' end of the mRNA as well as a polyA tail added to the 3' end of the mRNA. 

3. **Histones**:
   - Core concept: DNA is coiled around histones which prevents the transcription of DNA into RNA. 
   - Application: Histone modifications, including acetylation and methylation, alter chromatin structure to regulate gene accessibility. While acetylation generally promotes transacription by loosening chromatin, methylation can either activate or repress transcription depending on the specific residue modified. For example, H3K4me3 adds 3 methyl groups and is commonly found at TSS' (transcription start sites). H3K4me3 seems to be associated with regions of open, more accessible chromatin making it easier for transcription factors to bind and initiate gene expression.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Dawn of Molecular Biology
- Core Concept: DNA was "discovered" as the basis for biological information through a series of investigations and studies in the 1900s.
- Application: While it was known that nucleic acid was contained within chromosomes, scientists such as Avery and Mcleod were able to prove with experiments involving transferring the DNA of dead bacteria that were deadly into live non-deadly bacteria that it was DNA that was the "TP" or transforming principle. Watson and Crick were able to identify the structure of DNA via models and the images taken by other scientists.

### Chapter 2: RNA Connects Genes and Proteins
- Core Concept: The Central Dogma is that DNA -> RNA -> Proteins. While DNA explains how information is copied from generation to generation, RNA is how DNA is transformed into proteins. 
- Application: Important experiments involving plant viruses elucidated how RNA create proteins as some viruses contain no DNA and just RNA. Purified TMV RNA, without any proteins, was shown to be able to still infect plants. The experiments of the 1900s demonstrate clearly that DNA gets read into mRNA, which then gets converted to proteins in the ribosome. Codons are read by the ribosome which pairs a tRNA which contains an anti-codon. This attaches amino acids onto a growing polypeptide structure which becomes a protein. 

### Chapter 3: After mRNA: The Genetic Code, Translation, and the Biochemistry of Controlled RNA Synthesis in Bacteria
- Core Concept: The process of DNA conversion into proteins was uncovered through experiments on E. coli and bacteriophages.  
- Application: RNA polymerase reads the DNA into mRNA. This is done with the help of promoter proteins on the DNA and also operons in the DNA itself. Start and stop codons, AUG = start, UAG UGA and UAA = stop, signal the start and stop of protein synthesis. mRNA gets read in triplets (codons) by the Ribosome and paired with amino acids using tRNA. tRNA has an anticodon that matches the codon triplet and the amino acid attached to the tRNA gets added to the polypeptide chain. This is the "simple" process of DNA->RNA->Proteins in prokaryotes. 

### Chapter 4: Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells: Discovery of RNA Processing, Genes in Pieces, and New RNA Chemistry
- Core Concept: RNA processing is very distinct in eukaryotes and mammals in specific because much of the RNA is made in the nucleus but transported to the cytoplasm. There are many distinct steps in mammalian RNA processing such as the addition of methylation to the 5' and polyA to the 3' ends in the nucleus, processing of hnRNA, and the splitting of introns and exons to form mRNA.
- Application: A polyA tail is added to hnRNA (heterogeneous RNA which is a precursor to mRNA and contains both introns and exons) which helps stabilize the mRNA and allows it to a) be transported to the cytoplasm and b) survive degredation. The polyA tail on mRNA facilitates mRNA purification in the lab via chromatography using polyU (poly-dT columns) which bind to the sequence.

### Chapter 5: Controlling  mRNA: The Cell's Most Complicated Task
- Core Concept: Directing the construction of mRNA is complex and has multiple stages and requirements in eukaryotes. It involves positive acting activators that are site-specific DNA binding proteins. These recruit coactivators (protein complexes), they recruit histone modifying complexes, enzymes, GTFs (general transcription factors), and Pol II. The opposite also happens in that there are negative acting repressors that block GTFs, Pol II, and positive acting proteins. The repressors also recruit corepressors (protein complexes), that contain enzymes.
- Application: The steps to go from DNA to proteins is complex particularly in the processing and control of RNA. The challenge of the next century (or of this one) will be to study and understand RNA molecules **and RNA protein complexes**. There are many ways in which these complex interactions (Pol II, siRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, etc) are expressed and conversely repressed. Some flies, for example, have the same genes but determine sex by the production of a protein that **represses** other gene function.

### Chapter 6: RNA and the Beginning of Life
- Core Concept: RNA appears to have been the foundation of life before DNA and that early life was probably RNA based.
- Application: It has been shown that rRNA stripped of most of its proteins, can continue the peptidyl synthetase reactions and create almost all of the proteins in E. coli. The role of reverse transcriptase (RNA based) in telomere creation, RNA's informational carrying role in RNA only viruses, and the major function of rRNA in ribosomes even stripped of the remaining proteins show how RNA probably started life and its various important roles today. While DNA carries information, it does so only to allow RNA to do the heavy lifting.


## Most Valuable Insights
*The 3-5 most important or actionable insights from the book*

1. Simply having DNA does not result in it being read much of the time. There are complex transcription factors and protein complexes that initiate or suppress the conversion to mRNA and then to proteins itself.

2. Eukaryotic RNA processing is a complex evolutionary step that distinguishes eukaryotes from prokaryotes significantly. While prokaryotes can use the mRNA immediately after transcription, there is a process in eukaryotes by which pre-mRNA has introns cut and exons combined, tagged with various structures such as 5' capping and 3' polyA, and shaped thereby concluding in one or several pieces of mRNA. mRNA is **not as stable as DNA** and is tagged so that it can survive going from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 

3. RNA precipitates protein synthesis through expression or conversely **blocks protein synthesis** and regulates gene expression. siRNA, for example, is a by product of transcription that results in a double stranded RNA that is loaded into the RISC complex. RISC then uses one strand to target RNA similar to it and actively **suppress or repress** expression of that strand. lncRNAs, in another extraordinary finding, have been revealed to direct genomic loci silencing by directing protein complexes to sections of DNA that more likely lead to their silencing (histone modifications, etc).

## Criticism and Limitations
*Any apparent weaknesses in th arguments or areas not sufficiently addressed*
- While I very much enjoyed this book, I also had to re-watch [an MIT biology course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlVHqq38KJU&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63LmSVIVzy584-ZbjbJ-Y63) in order to educate myself on the lower level details.
