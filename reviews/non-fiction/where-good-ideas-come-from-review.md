## Book Information
- **Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation**: 
- **Steven Johnson**: 
- **2010**: 
- **Category/Genre**: Non-Fiction / Popular Science

## Context
*Steven Johnson is an author focusing on science and technology. In this book, he investigates the foundations and roots of innovation. Rather than focusing on individual genius, Johnson examines the systematic patterns from which innovations emerge.*

## Central Thesis
*Johnson argues that innovation is a result of a particular set of circumstances that can be deliberately cultivated. A central theme of this book is that innovation explores the adjacent possible; that there are many different potential outcomes and solutions based on a different combination or mixture of surrounding ideas, items, elements, etc. Innovation thrives in liquid networks where ideas can collide, connect, and cross-pollinate across disciplines and communities.*

## Key Frameworks and Models
*List and briefly explain the most important frameworks introduced*

1. **Adjacent Possible**: 
   - Core concept: Innovation is about exploring the **adjacent possible** which is a set of possible outcomes, solutions, and ideas created via the mixing of the currently existing resources. 
   - Application: Baby incubators help increase survival rates dramatically and was introduced into the developing world by a doctor who used common car parts. This meant that mechanics available around the world could use the spare parts in their shops to maintain and create incubators when the average cost of a first world incubator is $40,000.

2. **Liquid Networks**: 
   - Core concept: **Networks hosted on platforms** that support the mixing and socialization of ideas foster innovation. Many innovations require that ideas and resources mix in ways that allow for slow hunches or exaptations to occur. Liquid networks combine structure with flexibility, like neurons connected via chemical interactions.
   - Application: Cities and universities allow for a high rate of innovation as evidenced by the rapid and dramatic increase in new innovations after the formation of cities. They act as "coral reefs" for human innovation by allowing different combinations of the adjacent possible, connections to slow hunches, and exaptations of different ideas from different fields. The "discovery" of the structure of DNA occurred in a university lab with different departments and expertise. Francis Crick and James Watson were able to see the x-ray diffraction images of DNA itself that came from Rosalind Franklin which allowed them to complete the 3d model they were building in their own lab.

3. **Slow Hunches**:
   - Core concept: Innovations are often developed over time involving years, decades, or even centuries. 
   - Application: Charles Darwin had written out his thoughts which seem to outline and point to evolution over years in his notebook. After having read Malthuse on population, he claimed the idea for evolution hit him like an epiphany. It was most likely that it was simmering and the combination of a new idea or thought combined with the evidence he had gathered to form his innovative theory of evolution. We should be reading far and wide, documenting our thoughts, and collaborating or be involved in networks that allow for those hunches to accumlate into innovations.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Adjancent Possible
- The adjacent possible are the possible solutions and limits of outcomes based on existing resources and their potential combinations.
- Like with the elements that existed before life, there was an extraordinary amount of possible outcomes *but* only certain outcomes are possible.
- Sometimes there are good ideas but the resources we currently have do not allow for the desired solution; sometimes we just need to get more items. This was what happened with Babbage's original idea for the **Analytical Engine**. He failed not due a fault in design but that his time (1800s) lacked transistors and modern manufacturing.

### Chapter 2: Liquid Network
- When an idea in the brain forms, it requires a vast network of many neurons. In the same way, for innovations to occur you need **many** people or ideas that contain both structure and plasticity. 
- Order provides some structure and stability while chaotic interactions, like in a dense city of people, allows for different ideas to collide.
- Some famous buildings allowed for many different people to randomly interact with each other. In fact, some of the best ideas come not from scientists toiling away at their desks but rather from group conversations where different scientists both add to discussions and make connections to their disparate work.

### Chapter 3: The Slow Hunch
- Many hunches or ideas are incomplete. With the right connection, an incomplete idea can turn into a complete product or solution.
- Innovations often take decades because the right ideas need time and collision with other ideas that can be found in liquid networks.

### Chapter 4: Serendipity
- Activities, like walking, can trigger innovative insights by shifting our brain states and encouraging novel associations between disconnected ideas.
- Serendipity thrives in environments designed for chance encounters.
- You can help design an environment that leads to random collisions of ideas and thoughts.

### Chapter 5: Error
- Errors often lead to what were dismissed outcomes into actual solutions; failures often lead to new possibilities.
- Errors in genetic replication, aka mutations in dna, is a feature of evolution that allows life to try different combinations which may lead to better adaptations. It allows for adjacent possibilities via replication error.
- Rather than trying to completely eliminate error, we should prefer error-friendly environments that allow for and learn from errors.

### Chapter 6: Exaptation
- Exaptation in nature is when a particular feature was developed for one purpose, but it then gets repurposed and used in another manner.
- Guttenburg used the screw used to press wine in Germany (developed originally in Greece/Italy as mentioned by Pliny the Elder) and repurposed it in the printing press. 
- Many innovations are actually the combination of repurposed tools rather than entirely new technologies.

### Chapter 7: Platforms
- Coral building reefs build atolls that allow life to connect, diversify and innovate in various ways. In the same way, many human innovations are built on platforms that allow other ideas to connect.
- GPS is a government built platform from which many different solutions arose because it allows different ideas, or hunches, to be completed with different ideas on the platform.

### Chapter 8: Fourth Quadrant
- Many innovations come from non-market networks or market networks. Individual isolated innovations are rarer than commonly believed.
- Non-market innovation hubs, like universities or parisian cafes, encourage the free flow of ideas that spark new ideas, products, and solutions. They might outnumber the market based networks because market participants are incentivized to prevent the free flow of their ideas or products.
- This chapter challenges conventional wisdom that financial incentives are the primary drivers of innovation; Johnson argues that collaborative, non-proprietary environments may be as important for discoveries.

## Most Valuable Insights
*The 3-5 most important or actionable insights from the book*

1. Seek environments that allow for the chance collision of ideas and tools. 
2. Read far and wide, travel, walk, and place yourself in networks that increase the likelihood of completing your hunches or exploring more of the adjacent possible.
3. Support public platforms like universities or the government so that innovation can be nurtured and grown.
4. Embrace intelligent adjacency by exposing yourself to fields outside your field of expertise. Many solutions come from applying insights from one domain to problems in another.
5. Keep a notebook or journal to track incomplete ideas over time. Other innovations or ideas may help to complete those ideas.

## Criticism and Limitations
*Any apparent weaknesses in the arguments or areas not sufficiently addressed*
- Johnson often states his main points without thorough non-correlation based evidence. Much of his arguments suppose that correlation is enough to prove causation.
- Johnson was repetitive and some chapters, like Error, did not stress the main thesis in a strong enough manner.
